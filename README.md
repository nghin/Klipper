# Klipper

This printer.cfg works with a CR-10s, MKS Gen L, and 3D/BLTouch. There are some specialized extruder settings required by my very own 25:1 gear ratio extruder. Due to the higher gear ratio, I set the jumpers for the A4988 to 4 microsteps. The first vase mode print at 120 mm/s is fantastic, and this is before I tried any other fancy tuning for Klipper.
